<p>Anna of Arendelle is a fictional character who appears in <a href="http://disney.com " target="_self" title="welcome to disney studio">Walt Disney Animation Studio</a> 53rd animated film Frozen and its sequel Frozen II.
 She is voiced by Kristen Bell as an adult. At the beginning of the film, Livvy Stubenrauch and Katie Lopez provide her speaking and singing voice
  as a young child, respectively. Agatha Lee Monn portrayed her as a nine-year-old (singing). In Frozen II, Hadley Gannaway provided her voice as a
  young child while Stubenrauch is the archive audio.</p>

<p>Created by co-directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, Anna is loosely based on Gerda, a character from the Danish fairytale
"The Snow Queen" by Hans Christian Andersen. In the Disney film adaptation, Anna is depicted as the princess of Arendelle,
a fictional Scandinavian kingdom, and the younger sister of Princess Elsa (Idina Menzel), who is the heiress to the throne and possesses
the elemental ability to create and control ice and snow. When Elsa exiles herself from the kingdom after inadvertently sending Arendelle
 into an eternal winter on the evening of her coronation, fearless and faithful Anna is determined to set out on a dangerous adventure
to bring her sister back and save both her kingdom and her family.</p>


<p>The original fairytale in general and the character of the Snow Queen in particular posed long-term problems to adapt into
a feature-length production. Several film executives, including Walt Disney, made their attempts towards the story and numerous
adaptations were shelved as the filmmakers could not work out the characters. Finally, directors Buck and Lee solved the issue by
 portraying Anna and Elsa as sisters, establishing a dynamic relationship between the characters.</p>
